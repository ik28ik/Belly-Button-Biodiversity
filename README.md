### Belly-Button-Biodiversity

This repo contains homework from the Interactive Visualizations and Dashboardslecture series from The Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp.

An interactive dashboard was build to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


An horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu was build to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

A bubble chart was build to displays each sample.

Every time that a new sample is selected it will update all of the plots .
